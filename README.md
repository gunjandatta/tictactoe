# TicTacToe
I'm teaching myself TypeScript, so I created a simple project.

## Requirements
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Git](https://git-scm.com) must be installed first.

Bower must be installed by running:
```
$ npm install -g bower
```

## Installation
Run the following commands:
```
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

## Compile the TypeScript
```
$ tsc
```

## Run the Server
```
$ npm run test
```
