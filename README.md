# TicTacToe
I'm teaching myself TypeScript, so I created a small project.

## Requirements
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Git](https://git-scm.com) must be installed first.

Bower must be install by running:
```
$ npm install -g bower
```

## Installation
Run the following commands:
```
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm run test
```
